# 1MIB-PROJECT
Project
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an AI-driven system for automated Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change detection using multi-temporal satellite data. The solution leverages Artificial Intelligence, Agentic AI workflows, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect, analyze, and explain land-use changes such as urban expansion, deforestation, and vegetation loss. The project is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 15 (Life on Land), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

❓ Problem Statement

Traditional LULC change detection relies on manual or semi-automated GIS processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. With the growing availability of satellite imagery, there is a need for intelligent systems that can automatically detect changes and provide meaningful, explainable insights. This project addresses this gap by using AI to automate classification, change detection, and impact interpretation to support sustainable land management and data-driven decision-making.

💡 Proposed Solution

The solution uses an end-to-end AI-powered workflow that:

Classifies land cover types from satellite imagery

Detects changes across different time periods

Generates visual maps, statistics, and explainable summaries

Links detected changes to sustainability goals and policies

The system reduces manual GIS effort while improving accuracy, speed, and scalability.

🧠 AI Technologies Used

Machine Learning (ML):
For LULC classification and spatial change detection.

Agentic AI Workflows:
Autonomous AI agents manage data ingestion, classification, change analysis, and insight generation.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
Retrieves relevant environmental policies, SDG guidelines, and sustainability documents to generate context-aware explanations.

IBM Granite Foundation Models:
Used for responsible, explainable natural language generation of insights and impact summaries.

Prompt Engineering:
Guides AI models to produce transparent, accurate, and SDG-aligned outputs.

Multimodal AI:
Combines satellite imagery, vector LULC data, and textual documents.
